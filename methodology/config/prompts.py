HOMOPHONE_MAPPING_PROMPT = """\
Act as a linguistic data generator for a Speech-to-Text error simulation system.

**Task:** You will receive a JSON object where each key is an object class label and each value is ["empty"]. Replace ["empty"] with a list of exactly 5 plausible STT misrecognition strings for that label.

**Generation priority (use in order until you have 5):**
1. **True Homophones:** Words pronounced identically (e.g., "whale" -> "wail", "seal" -> "ceil").
2. **Common Phonetic Misspellings:** Plausible transcription errors (e.g., "oboe" -> "obo", "pretzel" -> "pretsul").
3. **Oronyms / Word-boundary Errors:** Re-segmentations that sound the same spoken aloud (e.g., "band aid" -> "banned aid", "ice cream" -> "I scream").
4. **Near-Homophones / Slant Rhymes:** Words that are confusable in fast or noisy speech (e.g., "otter" -> "udder", "crutch" -> "clutch").
5. **Accent / Dialect Variants:** Pronunciation-driven spellings from real dialects (e.g., "car" -> "cah", "oil" -> "earl").

**Constraints:**
- Return ONLY the completed JSON object. No markdown fences, no commentary, no preamble.
- Every key must appear EXACTLY as given — do not alter casing, spacing, punctuation, or hyphens.
- Provide exactly 5 distinct strings per key. No duplicates within a key's list.
- All 5 variants must be PHONETICALLY motivated. Do NOT use semantic associations (e.g., "computer keyboard" -> "typing device" is WRONG).
- For multi-word keys (e.g., "salt or pepper shaker"), treat the full phrase as a single spoken utterance and generate phonetic variants of that utterance.
- For brand names or loanwords (e.g., "iPod", "maillot"), generate variants based on how an English speaker would pronounce them.

**Example (do NOT include this in your output):**

Input:
{{
    "elephant": ["empty"],
    "band aid": ["empty"]
}}

Output:
{{
    "elephant": ["ella font", "elefant", "elegant", "ellie phant", "hell of ant"],
    "band aid": ["bandaid", "banned aid", "band ade", "banned ade", "ban dayed"]
}}

SYNONYM_MAPPING_PROMPT = """\
Act as a lexicographer generating synonym data for a visual object recognition system.

**Task:** You will receive a JSON object where each key is an object class label and each value is ["empty"]. Replace ["empty"] with a list of exactly 5 alternative names a person might naturally use to refer to that object when looking at it.

**Generation priority (use in order until you have 5):**
1. **Strict Synonyms:** Different words for the same object (e.g., "sofa" -> "couch", "automobile" -> "car").
2. **Colloquial / Informal Names:** Common everyday terms (e.g., "television" -> "TV", "refrigerator" -> "fridge").
3. **Hypernyms / Category Names:** The immediate parent category a person might default to (e.g., "oboe" -> "woodwind", "golden retriever" -> "dog").
4. **Descriptive Noun Phrases:** Natural ways to refer to the object (e.g., "waffle iron" -> "waffle maker", "baby bed" -> "infant crib").
5. **Technical / Formal Names:** Scientific, trade, or formal terms (e.g., "hippopotamus" -> "hippo", "Canine" for dog).

**Constraints:**
- Return ONLY the completed JSON object. No markdown fences, no commentary, no preamble.
- Every key must appear EXACTLY as given — do not alter casing, spacing, punctuation, or hyphens.
- Provide exactly 5 distinct strings per key. No duplicates within a key's list.
- All 5 values must be things a person could naturally CALL the object (noun phrases). Do NOT use adjectives, verbs, or descriptions of properties (e.g., "elephant" -> "large" is WRONG).
- For keys containing "or" (e.g., "cup or mug", "tv or monitor"), treat them as the general object concept and provide synonyms for that concept.
- For brand names (e.g., "iPod"), include both the generic category and common alternative brand references.

**Example (do NOT include this in your output):**

Input:
{{
    "sofa": ["empty"],
    "hat with a wide brim": ["empty"]
}}

Output:
{{
    "sofa": ["couch", "settee", "divan", "loveseat", "davenport"],
    "hat with a wide brim": ["sun hat", "wide-brim hat", "floppy hat", "broad-brimmed hat", "garden hat"]
